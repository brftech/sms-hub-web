5. **Enhanced Session Management**: Prevents session carryover between different user types

### Security Measures
- **Frontend Security**: Only anon key exposed in frontend
- **Admin Operations**: Moved to Edge Functions
- **Data Isolation**: Hub-based data separation
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation across all inputs

### Development Guidelines
1. **Type Safety**: Always maintain TypeScript type safety
2. **Styling**: Use styled-components only, no CSS files
3. **Multi-tenancy**: Always include hub_id in database operations
4. **Security**: Never expose service role key in frontend
5. **Testing**: Test all changes thoroughly before committing

### Code Review Process
1. Run type checking: `pnpm type-check`
2. Run linting: `pnpm lint`
3. Test authentication flow
4. Verify multi-tenant isolation
5. Check responsive design

This project represents a comprehensive, production-ready SMS SaaS platform with a clean architecture, robust type safety, and extensive functionality for managing SMS communications across multiple business hubs.
