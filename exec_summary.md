## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights

### **Multi-Tenant Hub System**

The application implements a sophisticated 4-hub multi-tenant architecture:

- **Hub 0**: PercyTech (red theme, technology focus)
- **Hub 1**: Gnymble (orange theme, primary brand, default)
- **Hub 2**: PercyMD (red theme, medical/HIPAA focus)
- **Hub 3**: PercyText (purple theme, messaging focus)

All data operations include `hub_id` filtering for proper tenant isolation, ensuring complete data separation between brands.

### **Technology Stack**

- **Frontend**: React 19.1.1, Vite 7.1.7, TypeScript 5.9.2
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.17, Styled Components
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL), Edge Functions (Deno)
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query 5.56.2
- **Deployment**: Vercel with CDN
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit), Playwright (E2E - 48 tests, 6 browsers)

### **Package Architecture**

The codebase uses a monorepo structure with local packages:

```
packages/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hub-logic/     # Hub configurations and branding logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ supabase/      # Database client and queries
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/            # Reusable UI components (90+ components)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/         # Shared utilities and validation
```

The `@sms-hub/ui/marketing` export provides optimized component bundles specifically for the marketing site, contributing to the impressive 91KB gzipped main bundle.

## üíæ Database Architecture

### **Marketing Database Schema**

The database schema is exceptionally well-designed with:

- **13 core tables** covering leads, email/SMS marketing, analytics, and auth
- **Comprehensive indexing** (50+ indexes) for optimal query performance
- **Multi-tenant support** with `hub_id` foreign keys on all tables
- **Lead tracking** with activities, scores, and conversion metrics
- **Marketing automation** tables for email and SMS campaigns

Key tables include:

- `leads` - Primary lead capture with scoring and conversion tracking
- `email_subscribers` / `email_campaigns` - Email marketing infrastructure
- `sms_subscribers` / `sms_campaigns` - SMS marketing with consent tracking
- `contact_form_submissions` - Form submissions with UTM tracking
