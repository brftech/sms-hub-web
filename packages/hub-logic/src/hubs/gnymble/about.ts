  storyTitle: "How Gnymble Started",
  storyParagraphs: [
    "It started with a phone call from a cigar lounge owner. He'd been rejected by three SMS platforms in one week. Each time, the same reason: 'high-risk industry.' His business was legitimate, compliant, and profitable. But to the big SMS platforms, he was just a liability.",
    "That's when we realized: an entire category of businesses - regulated, premium, successful businesses - were being shut out of modern customer communication. Not because they were doing anything wrong, but because most platforms don't want to deal with the complexity of SHAFT compliance.",
    "So we built Gnymble. A platform that doesn't run from regulated businesses - we specialize in them. We understand compliance. We know the regulations. We've built the workflows. And we never, ever reject accounts just because you're in a regulated industry.",
