  storyParagraphs: [
    "A family practice called us frustrated. They were spending hours manually calling patients for appointment reminders. When they tried SMS platforms, they found generic tools that didn't understand HIPAA, didn't provide Business Associate Agreements, and couldn't handle healthcare workflows.",
    "That's when we realized: healthcare providers needed a platform built specifically for them. Not a general SMS tool with 'HIPAA compliance' tacked on. But a platform that understood patient privacy, medical workflows, and healthcare regulations from the ground up.",
    "So we built PercyMD. HIPAA-compliant from day one. Business Associate Agreements with every practice. Features designed for healthcare workflows. And support from people who understand medical practice operations.",
