    "A growing e-commerce company came to us with a problem: Twilio was costing them thousands per month, but the 'affordable' alternatives kept failing during high-volume campaigns. They needed enterprise reliability without enterprise pricing.",
    "We realized many businesses face this same dilemma. They need professional SMS infrastructure, developer-friendly APIs, and reliable delivery. But they can't justify spending $5,000+ per month on a Twilio contract.",
    "So we built PercyTech. Enterprise-grade infrastructure with transparent, fair pricing. Comprehensive APIs with great documentation. Reliable delivery at scale. And support from people who actually help solve problems.",
