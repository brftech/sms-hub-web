  storyParagraphs: [
    "A local shop owner called us overwhelmed. She'd signed up for an SMS platform that promised 'powerful features' - but she just wanted to send appointment reminders. The interface had hundreds of buttons. The docs were 200 pages long. She gave up.",
    "That's when we realized: most businesses don't need enterprise features. They need simple, reliable SMS. Send a message. Track delivery. Manage contacts. That's it.",
    "So we built PercyText. Clean interface with only what you need. Setup that takes minutes, not days. Straightforward pricing that makes sense. And support from real people when you need help.",
